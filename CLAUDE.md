# War Element — Notes for Claude

If you're a fresh Claude session opening this repo, read this first. It's the
handoff doc, not user-facing copy — the README is the player-facing one.

**This project is independent of `creed-app`.** Different repo, different
remote, different owner-facing product. Nothing here touches creed-app's
deploy path, and creed-app's conventions (its `.bb`/`.cd` CSS classes, its
Supabase/db helpers, its CLAUDE.md) do **not** apply here. If you were sent
here from a creed-app session, drop those assumptions.

## What this is

A TCG × chess card game. Draw → resource → turn-based prep → speed-queue
battle → win by **elimination** or **slot capture**. One local human (P1,
bottom) vs. a rule-based AI (P2, top).

Vite 6 + React 19 + TypeScript. Repo at `C:\Users\IlIKingPin\war-element`,
remote `github.com/creedhandyman/war-element`. Supabase is a dependency but
the game itself is local-first; the engine has no network calls.

**Deploy**: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` auto-deploys `main` to Vercel
production. **The workflow runs `npm test` as a gate** — a failing test blocks
the deploy. Card art is in Git LFS (~837MB) and the workflow caches it, so
don't casually re-add large binaries.

## Layout

```
src/
  engine/          Pure TypeScript. No React imports anywhere in here.
    types.ts       CardDef / CardInstance / GameState / StatusKind. The contract.
    cards.ts       → actually lives in src/data/, see below
    state.ts       createInitialState, boardCards, healCard, effectiveDmg/Sp/MaxHp
    phases.ts      The phase machine: mulligan → prep → battle → CLEANUP. Big.
    combat.ts      resolveHit / basicAttack + the SPECIAL_HANDLERS registry. Biggest.
    rules.ts       Legality: canTarget, canMove, legalMoves, validTargets
    auras.ts       ELEMENT_AURA — the per-element passive every card of it carries
    matchups.ts    ELEMENT_MATCHUP — the cross-element rules (see below)
    spells.ts      Spellbook + spell defs + spellCapForBoard
    ai.ts          aiMulligan / aiPrepIntent / chooseBattleAction
    rng.ts         Seeded RNG — coin/chance/pctChance/randInt/shuffle
    stats.ts       Post-match credit tracking
    __tests__/     29 files, ~850 tests. `npm test` runs them headless.
  data/
    cards.ts       THE card database. ~9k lines, 312 cards + 16 tokens. Edit surgically.
  ui/              React. App/Board/Slot/Hand/CardDetail/DeckBuilder/…
public/cards/      <id>.webp per card (Git LFS)
```

`src/data/cards.ts` is the file you'll touch most. It is enormous — **never
rewrite it, only make targeted edits.** For bulk stat changes across several
cards, an id-anchored Python pass is safer than a dozen hand edits (find the
card's `id: "..."`, slice to the next `\n  {\n`, regex within that block only).

## Commands

```
npm run dev     # Vite on 5173 by default
npm test        # vitest run — the whole suite, ~6s
npm run build   # tsc --noEmit && vite build
```

Preview via the launch.json entry named `war-element`, which pins
**port 5199** (`--port 5199 --strictPort`). A bare `npm run dev` does NOT pass
that flag and lands on 5173 — the two disagree, so know which one you started.

## The rules that keep the card set coherent

**Stat budget.** `dmg*hits + hp + shields*2 + sp ≈ 5*cost + 10`, tolerance ±2.
Enforced by `state.test.ts`. A card outside the band needs an entry in that
file's `exceptions` Set **with a comment naming the ability that pays for the
deviation**. Don't add exceptions to silence the test — if you can't name the
payoff, the stats are wrong.

Note the `+10` constant: cheaper cards are inherently more efficient per gold
(a cost-3 gets 25 points for 3, a cost-5 gets 35 for 5). Rebasing a card down
a cost tier and retrimming to the new budget is therefore a real buff to
tempo/deployment even though the card gets numerically smaller. That's the
lever used on LEAF's mid-range.

**Rarity.** A *repeatable* Special requires epic-or-above. A Rare gets a
**Talent** instead — `special: { talent: true, … }`, which is free but fires
once per game (`card.talentUsed`).

**Art.** Every card and token needs `public/cards/<id-or-art-field>.webp`, and
`art.test.ts` fails the build if one is missing. Convert supplied PNGs with
PIL (`Image.open(p).convert("RGB").save(q, "WEBP", quality=88)`) then delete
the source PNG. Watch for filename/id mismatches (`bolt_static_cloud.png` vs
id `bolt_staticcloud`).

**Card text.** `card-text.test.ts` enforces that every ability field is
described somewhere in `CardDetail.tsx`'s describers — add a new `CardDef`
field and that test will tell you it's undescribed. It also guards against
empty passive labels (`"On a kill: ."`), which is how several describer gaps
were originally found.

## Element systems

Two separate layers, don't confuse them:

- **`auras.ts` — ELEMENT_AURA**: the passive every card of that element
  carries (LEAF Photosynthesis, PYRO Scorch, BOLT Electrify…). The table is
  display copy; the effects live at hook sites, mostly the Cleanup loop in
  `phases.ts`.
- **`matchups.ts` — ELEMENT_MATCHUP**: how elements answer *each other*.
  Hooks at four sites — `resolveHit` (the DAWN↔DUSK ±25% swing, GALE's 20%
  dodge vs BORE, LEAF's water-fed heal), `applyStatus` (AQUA/BORE/GALE status
  resistances), `healCard` (a BURNing card heals at 75%).

Two design invariants there, both deliberate and both commented in the file:
**resistances, never immunities** (an immunity deletes an entire aura in one
matchup rather than answering it), and the damage bonus is **floored, not
rounded** (`Math.round(2 * 1.25) === 3` is a 50% swing that a 3-hit volley
then compounds).

`ELEMENT_MATCHUP` is deliberately `Partial<Record<Element, …>>` — BOLT has no
entry, because its aura already answers status-carriers and it measured top of
the ladder.

**Not yet done:** the matchup table isn't surfaced in the card inspector the
way `ELEMENT_AURA` is. Players feel these rules without being told them.

## Measuring balance

There's no committed balance harness — build a disposable one, read it, delete
it. Convention: name it `src/engine/__tests__/zzz-*.test.ts` so it sorts last
and is obviously temporary, and **delete it before committing**.

Drive matches through the public intent API exactly as `ai.test.ts` does:
`createInitialState` → loop `needsP1Input(s) ? driveP1(s) : advance(s)` until
`s.phase === "gameover"`. Copy `driveP1` from `ai.test.ts` — it handles the
`FLOW_CHANGE` / `MULLIGAN` / `prep` / `battle` branches.

Two traps that have both burned real time:

1. **`deckById()` silently falls back to `DECKS[0]`** for any id it doesn't
   recognize — including the solo-element core ids (`"leaf"`, `"pyro"`, …),
   which live in `CORES`, not `DECKS`. A harness passing core ids therefore
   runs leaf_pyro-vs-leaf_pyro every match and reports a meaningless flat 50%
   across the board. **Pass `CORES[i].cards` (the string array) directly.**
   The fallback itself is still in the code — a latent bug worth fixing if any
   other caller ever passes an unrecognized id.
2. **`state.win` is `{ winner, by }`, not a player string.** `end.win === "P1"`
   is always false and every element reports 0%.

A full 8-core round-robin, both seats, 14 seeds = 784 matches ≈ 40s.

### Two metrics that look convincing and are not

Both of these produced a confident, wrong "this card is overpowered" list, and
both cost a full round of nerfs before being caught. Do not trust either one
on its own.

1. **Win-rate-when-played is CORRELATIONAL.** Aggregating `state.stats.byCard`
   and asking "when this card reached the board, how often did its side win?"
   ranks engine pieces and 6-drops at the top — because they only *land* in
   games that were already going well. It flagged Sling at +28.9 over its
   element; ablation later showed Sling contributes **+0.0**. The tell that
   something was wrong: two real mechanical nerfs (Beebot's damage fell exactly
   25%, Aurora's orbs were cut and then capped) moved the win rates by nothing,
   and Aurora's came back byte-identical over 1,120 matches.

2. **Ablation needs a CONTROL GROUP.** Cutting a card and re-measuring its
   element is causal, but a smaller deck draws its best cards more often, so
   *every* removal looks like an improvement. Measured on BOLT: Shock −2.1,
   General −2.4, Velvolt Knight −2.4, Zagphu −5.4, Keeper −6.5. Read against
   that ~−3 baseline, Keeper is unremarkable; read alone, it looks like the
   worst card in the game. Always ablate 3–4 same-element peers alongside the
   suspect and compare the SPREAD.

Sampling error is the other trap: one 336-match ablation run carries roughly
±5 points at 95%, so a 3-point gap is noise. Scale seeds up before believing a
small difference, and quote n.

The honest summary of that whole exercise: **no card was found to be measurably
overpowered.** The real finds were design flaws that measurement never
surfaced — Aurora's unbounded orb recharge and Keeper's Hive Mind absorbing to
the death. Both were fixed on reasoning, not on a win-rate delta.

### Where balance stood at last measure

```
dusk 56.1 · bolt 55.1 · aqua 53.1 · pyro 51.0
dawn 50.5 · gale 49.0 · bore 47.4 · leaf 37.8     spread 18.3
```

**LEAF is the standing problem.** Four passes (stat top-ups → roots →
mid-range cost cuts → matchups) moved it 34.2 → 37.8, roughly a point each.
What the diagnostics showed: it wasn't losing a positional race, it was being
*wiped* — ending matches with 0.75 cards alive to AQUA's 5.50 while holding
**more unspent gold than its opponent**. The cost rebase fixed most of the
board-presence collapse (0.75 → 2.51 alive); the win rate barely followed. The
remaining hypothesis, untested: LEAF's payoffs are overwhelmingly end-of-round
ticks and heals, which resolve *after* the exchange that decided the slot.

Premade-deck (not solo-core) numbers are stale — they predate the Warthog /
Rollo / Zombination / Doom changes and everything since.

## Working style

- **Commits land directly on `main`.** No PRs. Push triggers the deploy.
- **Verify before committing**: `npx tsc --noEmit`, then `npm test`, then
  `npx vite build`. All three, in that order.
- **Don't blind-update a failing test to match new output.** When a balance
  change breaks assertions, check the actual card elements/stats involved and
  confirm the new number is *right*. Doing this is how the DAWN↔DUSK rounding
  bug and the heal-before-cleanse ordering bug were both caught — the tests
  were correct and the implementation wasn't.
- **Don't run destructive git** (force-push, `reset --hard`) without an
  explicit ask.
- Commit messages: explain *why* the numbers moved and quote the measurement
  when there is one.

## Open threads

- LEAF still ~9 points below the field (see above).
- `ELEMENT_MATCHUP` has no UI surface.
- `deckById`'s silent fallback (see Measuring balance).
- Spell curve expansion — the big queued feature. Today's `spells.ts` has the
  cost-1 spell per element + the 8 cost-4 Walls + some Fields; the spec covers
  a full 1–10 curve per element (80 spells) plus **Trap** (hidden, fires when
  an opponent moves onto the slot) and **Field** sub-types. Spec lives in
  `Spells_All_Elements.md` + `PYRO_Spells_Prototype.md` (Downloads).
- Card ability source-of-truth is
  `Desktop\Everything\war element\*_Cards.docx` + `War_Element_Rules.docx` —
  the full printed abilities, which the alpha `cards.ts` simplified. Extract
  with `unzip -p X.docx word/document.xml`.

## Story Mode

`src/data/story.ts` is the whole campaign layer: pure data + pure functions, no
engine runtime and no React, so it stays testable headlessly
(`src/engine/__tests__/story.test.ts`, ~40 tests). UI is `StoryMap.tsx`
(region map + node panel) and `StoryResult.tsx` (post-battle recruitment).

- **Nodes are placed on painted art.** `node.at` is a **percentage** of the
  region map's width/height, not a grid unit — resolution-independent, and the
  art can be re-exported at any size without moving a node. Maps live at
  `public/maps/<region>.webp` and are referenced by `region.art`. The maps are
  **3:2** (1536×1024); `MAP_RATIO` in StoryMap holds the canvas to it, and the
  edge SVG uses `viewBox="0 0 100 100"` + `preserveAspectRatio="none"` so edges
  and nodes share one coordinate space with no px maths.
  To eyeball placement, render markers onto the art with PIL rather than
  screenshotting — the node ids and edges plot straight from `story.ts`.
  Two CSS rules are load-bearing and were both learned the hard way on a phone:
  `.story-canvas` must be `flex: none` (`.story-body` becomes a COLUMN on
  phones, and a growable canvas stretches to fill the height, overriding
  `aspect-ratio` and scaling the art ~3x tall since it is drawn with
  `background-size: 100% 100%`); and every `.edge` needs
  `vector-effect: non-scaling-stroke`, or the `viewBox="0 0 100 100"` +
  `preserveAspectRatio="none"` combination scales `stroke-width: 2` into a
  ~20px slab. Node/badge sizes are `cqw`-based off `container-type: inline-size`
  on the canvas, so they track the map rather than the viewport — 54px at
  desktop's 1180px cap, ~41px on a phone.
- **Border gates (§7)**: a region is entered by CLEARING A GATE, not by clearing
  the previous Throne — the Throne only unlocks the gate. Gates are nodes of
  `kind: "gate"` on the SOURCE region's map, and `region.requires` lists the
  gates that open it, satisfied by **ANY** of them (not all): AQUA is reachable
  through LEAF's Eastleaf Port *or* PYRO's Sunfall Harbor, so an AQUA-first
  player never has to walk back through LEAF for the second road. Gate C exists
  twice, once on each side (`GC` / `GC2`), because it is bidirectional.
  A gate's squad lives in **`adds`**, not `roster` — it is a mixed border patrol
  of both elements and a checkpoint rather than a farm, so putting real cards in
  a recruitable roster would place them a second time. That makes gates the one
  exception to the adds-are-tokens rule. `gateCheck` enforces §7's two halves:
  deck length **exactly** at the cap, plus a composition demand. Gates take no
  Blight (a checkpoint is not territory) and `buildFormation` falls back to the
  patrol for its duplicate fill, since a gate has no roster to draw on.
- **Regions**: LEAF (open), plus PYRO and AQUA (formerly `requires: ["L14"]` — the
  doc's Act II branch, neither privileged). Each carries its own `artRatio`:
  AQUA's painting is 4:3 where LEAF's and PYRO's are 3:2, and forcing one shape
  would crop somebody's map. A region gate is
  separate from node gates, and `isOpen` checks BOTH — every region's entry node
  has no prerequisites of its own, so without the region check PYRO's P1 would
  read as open on turn one. The map header grows an element switcher once a
  second region is reachable. A battle takes its board size and Blight from the
  NODE's own region (`regionOfNode`), never from whichever map is on screen.
- **Overflow points forward, not back.** PYRO's northern border faces LEAF, but
  every LEAF card cheap enough to qualify is already in the 12-card starter — so
  bleeding one there would hand the player something they own on day one. Only
  the AQUA sea gate at Sunfall Coast carries overflow. A test enforces that no
  overflow card is in `STARTER_DECK`.
- **The art is the authority on geography.** LEAF's node graph was re-gated to
  match it: the Rot Line is in the far *south* (so L8 hangs off L5, not L7),
  and Rustling Woods is at Autumn's Gold in the *north-east* (so L7 hangs off
  L10, making the north arc run west→north→east). Overflow follows the painted
  gates — AQUA at Eastleaf Port (L7), PYRO at the Southern Burn (L8).
- **Edges are derived from `requires`**, never a separate table, so the drawn
  map can't drift from the gating actually enforced.
- **One card, one node** — `story.test.ts` enforces that every draftable LEAF
  card is placed exactly once, that no roster contains a token, and that **no
  node is dead on arrival** (a node whose whole roster is already in the
  starter deck can never pay out; L1 and L2 both shipped that way once).
- **Recruiting**: one roll per captured slot (min 1); base odds by rarity
  (`DROP_RATE`), `PITY_STEP` per dry clear, guaranteed Mythic on a Throne's
  first clear. Owned cards drop out of the pool, so repeat clears self-target.
- **§10.5 Overflow**: `node.overflow` bleeds cheap Rares from the *neighbouring*
  region at **half base rate** (pity still accrues at full step, so a border
  card is slower but never unreachable). The card keeps its home node.
- **§10.4 The Blight**: DUSK spreads into **cleared** regions only — difficulty
  rises behind you, never in front — which is what makes it safe to be
  aggressive. `blightLevel` = `max(baseBlight, earned)` capped at 3; rises on
  **Throne clears anywhere**, never on idle time (farming is never punished).
  L1–2 add non-recruitable DUSK bodies to Warden-tier and up (Skirmishes and
  Thrones are spared); L2 contests the region's terrain; L3 spawns a generated
  **Blight Node** at `region.blightAt` that *does* drop DUSK — the only way to
  field DUSK early — and clearing it drops the level by one, flooring at the
  region's own `baseBlight`. A Blight Node is never banked into `save.cleared`
  (it can come back). **DUSK and DAWN are immune** (`canBlight`).
- **The collection** (`StoryCollection.tsx`) is the browser AND the story deck
  editor — the same question asked twice ("what do I own" / "what do I fight
  with"), so splitting them would just mean bouncing between screens. Its
  load-bearing half is **Missing**: every unowned card names the node that
  drops it and the live odds there, which is what makes pillar 3 ("you fight
  what you want to own") actually true. `sourcesOf` / `bestSource` in story.ts
  invert the placement data rather than duplicating it, so a node move can
  never desync the answer — tests enforce that every placed card resolves to a
  node that really lists it, and that a full-odds home always sorts before a
  half-odds border. The denominator is `PLACED_CARDS`, not the 300-card set, so
  the counter doesn't read as broken while regions are unbuilt; a card in an
  unbuilt region says "Not in the world yet" rather than appearing as a to-do.
  It opens OVER the map, so "Show" on a card hands a node id back via
  `focusNodeId` (consumed once, then cleared, or it would re-select forever).
  On phones the deck rail stacks BELOW the grid, where an always-open rail took
  more height than the cards it supports — it collapses to a sticky bottom bar
  there and stays open on desktop. Selecting a card force-opens it, since the
  card detail lives inside that collapsible body. Note `.col-wrap .story-body`
  is `overflow: hidden` for the desktop two-column scroll but MUST be `auto` on
  phones: nested scroll containers starved the grid to a 371px window holding
  9,945px of cards.
- **Music**: `useGameMusic.ts` keys off a TRACK, not a menu/battle flag. A story
  region owns the sound for both its map AND its battles (`REGION_TRACK`), so a
  region reads as a place and entering a fight doesn't restart the audio — the
  effect's deps don't change, so nothing re-plays. Regions without an entry fall
  back to the menu/battle pair, so shipping a map before its music is fine. The
  audio pool is built ON DEMAND: `public/music` is ~28MB across four tracks, and
  a player who never opens Story Mode should never fetch its themes. All tracks
  are 96 kb/s — they are looping ambience under SFX, and 320 kb/s masters cost
  3x the bytes for nothing. Transcode with the ffmpeg that ships inside the
  `imageio-ffmpeg` pip package; there is no system ffmpeg on this machine.
  All five are also loudness-matched to **-16 LUFS** (EBU R128, two-pass, -1.5
  dBTP ceiling). They arrived 5.9 dB apart and every one of them clipped, so
  switching regions changed the volume. Normalize from the MASTER, not from the
  committed 96k file, or you stack two generations of lossy encoding.

## Traps found the hard way

- **Auto modes are `manual | basic | full`, and only `full` fires Specials.** A
  card on `basic` with nothing in reach used to SKIP, forever. For Oakgre that
  was fatal rather than annoying: it is printed at **SP 0**, and Uprooted (+3 SP)
  is the only thing that ever unpins it — so it could not reach anyone, never
  fired the buff, and never moved for the whole game. `basic` now fires a
  Special when the turn would otherwise be wasted entirely AND the Special is
  `targetSide: "self"` (no targeting decision taken from the player). `manual`
  still prompts. Regression test: `self-buff-auto.test.ts`.
  When testing an auto-mode policy, the side under test must be in `humans` —
  an AI-driven side runs `chooseBattleAction` instead and fires the Special
  anyway, so the test would pass without the fix.

## Repo size

`.git` hit 1.08GB in Aug 2026. Almost none of it was history:

- **863MB was a dead Git LFS cache** — art was migrated OUT of LFS in Jul 2026
  (see `.gitattributes`) but the local objects were never pruned. `git lfs
  prune` reported *403 local objects, 0 retained* and freed all of it.
- **The repo had never been gc'd** — 6,878 loose objects, zero packfiles.
  `git gc --prune=now` took 219MB of loose objects to a 159MB pack.

Together: **1082MB -> 160MB, with no history rewriting.** Reach for `lfs prune`
and `gc` before ever considering a rewrite; the big binaries in history (50MB of
music, 82MB of superseded card WebP) are worth far less than they look, and
purging them would only reach ~120MB in exchange for rewriting every SHA.
- **Formations (§10.7)**: an enemy squad is a FORMATION, not a deck — it may
  field several copies of a card, so a 3-card roster still fills a board at any
  tier. `buildFormation` fills to `formationSize(deckCap)` in the doc's order:
  every unique first (four identical cards reads as a bug, not a boss), then
  tokens and Blight bodies, then duplicate Rares cheapest-first, then Epics.
  Caps scale with the tier via `copyCapFor`: Rares duplicate up to 3 at every
  Act, **Epics stay unique until cap 18** (`EPIC_DUPLICATE_FROM_CAP`, Act III) and
  double from there, Legendary and Mythic never. A second Epic is a second copy
  of a real Special every round, which is not what an Act I board should be
  padded with. The duplicate pool is drawn from roster + overflow **+ adds**,
  because a Throne's roster is a lone Mythic and a Gate has no roster at all —
  without them a boss fight was two bodies. Thrones also carry **2 Rare escorts**
  in `adds`, drawn from a tribe or locale they already command and farmable
  earlier in the region, which brings every Throne up to the tier target.
  The `adds` rule is **not** "tokens only" — it is that filler must never be the
  ONLY place a card appears, or it would be permanently unrecruitable. Gate
  patrols and Throne escorts are real cards on purpose; the test checks
  `sourcesOf(id)` rather than token-ness. It never TRIMS — a roster card dropped to hit the target would be
  unrecruitable that run. The load-bearing guardrail is that recruitment rolls
  once per UNIQUE card however many copies are on the board: duplicates are a
  difficulty knob, not a loot knob, and a test pins it.
- **Opening deployment (§10.6)** — **STORY-ONLY.** Each side leads with **one
  free teammate** before round one, then the ordinary game resumes; a Throne
  leads with two. It shipped as a 4-card / 10-gold opening board and was scaled
  back — a whole formation landed before anyone had made a decision. One card
  asks the only interesting question ("who do you lead with?") and leaves the
  rest traditional. The placement costs **nothing**: `canSummon` skips the gold
  check while `state.opening` is set and the SUMMON intent skips the deduction,
  so a side at 0 gold can still place. Skirmish, online and Void Tower are
  untouched — `createInitialState`'s `opening` param is what turns it on.
  Implemented as a prep turn at round 0 rather than a new phase, so every summon
  rule, intent and bit of UI works unchanged; `movedThisTurn` stays true so
  nothing repositions yet. Two traps, both test-pinned:
  There is also a **cost ceiling** (`OPENING_COST_CAP`, in types.ts so rules.ts
  can read it without importing the phase machine). "Free" otherwise means cost
  stops being a brake for exactly one card and every side just leads with the
  biggest thing it drew — a Throne would open with its Mythic on turn zero.
  Two traps, both test-pinned:
  1. **Gold must not leak into round 1.** `doResourcePhase` carries gold (capped
     10) and *then* adds income, so anything seeded here would inflate the first
     turn. Round 1 must pay its normal +1 and no more.
  2. **A summon lands in the home row, which is exactly `boardSize` wide**, so
     slots are clamped to the board — granting more than that silently does
     nothing.

- **Save** is one localStorage key, `we_story_v1`, sanitized on load (unknown
  card/node ids are dropped). To exercise a mid-campaign state in the browser,
  seed it directly rather than playing forward.
